# Technical studies in electronic engineering

> 你好!这里是EternoPax.写这个项目是由于当今技术不再是依赖单独的一个技术,现在更多的是要依赖各种知识.在高速信号发展的现在,高速PCB的设计更是一个重点,但是,市面上都是在讲解理论,缺少实践,同时,市面上的教程也很少.这个项目更多的是自己的学习记录,希望自己的学习方式可以帮助大家.

> Hello! This is EternoPax. The reason for creating this project is that today's technology no longer relies on a single technology; instead, it increasingly depends on a variety of knowledge. In the current era of rapid signal development, the design of high-speed PCBs is a focal point. However, the market is filled with theoretical explanations and lacks practical applications. At the same time, there are very few tutorials available. This project is more of a personal learning record, and I hope that my learning methods can be helpful to everyone.
